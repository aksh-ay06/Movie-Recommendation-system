# Movie-Recommendation-system
This is a content based recommender system build by me. I used the approach of vectorization, bag of words technique. I have extracted tags from the whole dataset for each movie, and based on the tags the movies are being recommended.

Cosine Similarity is:

a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space
the cosine of the trigonometric angle between two vectors
the inner product of two vectors normalized to length 1
applied to vectors of low and high dimensionality
not a measure of vector magnitude, just the angle between vectors
